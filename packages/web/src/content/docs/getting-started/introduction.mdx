LWC Garden aims to be a replacement for the official Salesforce [`@salesforce/lwc-dev-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@salesforce/lwc-dev-server), which has not received an update since 2021.

LWC Garden brings an array of new features and customisation so you can develop how you want to, locally.

LWC Garden provides two places for configuration:

1. [Global Configuration](/reference/configuration): `garden.config.js` at the root of your project.
2. [Component Configuration](/reference/component-configuration): LWC specific `garden.config.js` that lives in your LWC folder.
